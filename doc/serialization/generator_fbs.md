# Understanding `generator.fbs`

See [generator.fbs](../../buildcc/schema/generator.fbs)

## Current Feature Progress

- [x] IOFileGenerator
    - Currently named `base::Generator`
- [ ] TemplateFileGenerator
- [ ] CustomCallbackGenerator

# Input/Output File Generator

See [Input/Output File Generator API](../../buildcc/lib/target/include/target/generator.h)

## Definition

- An IO file generator takes user supplied command strings consisting of an executable invocation over one or more input files.
- The goal of these executable invocation over input files is to **generate** output files. Hence the name IO File Generator.
- An IO File Generator can be of the following variety
    - Single input generates single output
    - Single input generates multiple outputs
    - Multiple inputs generate single output
    - Multiple inputs generate multiple outputs

## Correlation with schema file

- `inputs` are physically present files on the disk
    - These files can be generated by another `Target` or `Generator` but will eventually be present
- `outputs` are future files depending on input states, only path strings are stored
- `commands` are ordered list of executable invocation strings. These perform actions on `input` files.
    - NOTE: TO make `commands` run in parallel if they do not need to be ordered set `parallel = true` in the Generator constructor.
